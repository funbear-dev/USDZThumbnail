USDZThumbnail
(c) 2024 - funbear GmbH

This is a SwiftUI project created to showcase and take snapshots of .usdz Entities through drag & drop. These can be moved, rotated and zoomed to capture the perfect thumbnail for use in an app's previews, like TableViews and CollectionViews, or to display a gallery of available models, in PNG and JPG formats.

To facilitate the workflow, camera settings can be saved so that taking snapshots of similar objects is as quick as dragging the next model into the main window and capturing the image.

Currently, the Skybox lighting feature does not work, while Apple docs and several Internet sources state that our implementation is correct.
